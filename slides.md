- If you need a question answered later, use the Padlet link to submit your question
- Resource sharing will be done on Padlet
- Slide may not be pretty as you :)
- 2 Hours is a very very very long time :')

# Introduction to  <br/> VS Code

## What is VS Code ?

<br/>

> Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.[^1]

It is used by developers to code in a various programming languages, but it is especially powerful for web development.


The code of the editor is completely Open Source, and there’s no payment required to use it.

It uses Electron as its base, which enables it to be cross platform and work on Mac, Windows and Linux. It’s built using Node.js, and you can extend it using JavaScript

[^1]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs
---

## Some features of Visual Studio Code:

- syntax Highlighting
- built-in Git
- code completion - Intellisense
- automatic Formatting
- plenty of keyboard shortcuts
- extensions/Plugins

These features are not only present on VS Code but generally available in other code editors and IDE

## What is a Code Editor


**Code editor** : A text editor designed for writing and editing source code. Source code editors are distinguished from text editors because they enhance or simplify the writing and editing of code.

Some code editors
- VS Code
- Sublime text
- Notepad++
- Atom
- Brackets
- Vim

---

## What is an IDE ?

**IDE**
 :  is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface 
- Code editor
- Debugger
- Build automation tools

Some available IDE
- InteliJ
- Android Studio
- Arduino IDE
- Webstorm
- PyCharm

`A code editor is a text editor that has some good features for writing code, and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is something usually more complex that combines a couple of different tools together.`
---

## Why choose VS Code ? 

- VS Code is simple to download and install on any OS.
- It is completely free and open source
- It’s easy to customize and has many useful extensions.
- It has powerful IDE-like features including a built-in debugger and terminal.

## Point of Discussion on hand on session
- Installation
- Explorer & Search
- Source Control
- Debugger
- Extensions
- Terminal
- Command Palette
- Themes

# Introduction to  <br/> Git and GitHub[^1]


[^1]: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/

---

## What is Git
- Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
- Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the project code as with old VCSs like CVS or SVN with Git every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes for the project

## What’s a version control system?
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, new code get added. With the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:
- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?

<p class="text-sm">Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place.</p>

---

## What’s a distributed version control system?
- DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. 
- Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS)
- Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.

## How GitHub fits in

GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is built.

---

# Basic Git commands

- `git init` initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.
- `git clone` creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. 
- `git add` stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. 
- `git commit` saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. 
- `git status` shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- `git branch` shows the branches being worked on locally.
- `git merge` merges lines of development together.
- `git pull` updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. 
- `git push` updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

---

# The GitHub flow

The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented

- `Create a branch` Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually main)
- `Add commits`  Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.
- `Open a pull request` Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.
- `Discuss and review code`  Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.
- `Merge`  Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.
- `Deploy` Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.

## Why do you need a portfolio [^1]

Creating a portfolio allows you to achieve a variety of things that don’t translate to the typical resume:

- **Show your code** Spend some time creating projects to learn how to code. Have a few examples will show off your coding ability in existence.
- **Express your personality**. Your life and body of work is more than just a piece of paper. Your portfolio can help the employer get a better idea of how well you’ll fit in at their company, which also helps ensure you don’t take a job you’re not a good fit for.
- **Improve your online footprint.** A lot of employers judge your initial application based on the quality of your online footprint. Essentially, this just means what they find when they Google your name.

## What Should You include? [^1]
- Your name. Self-explanatory.
- Contact information. 
- Your skills.
- Information about yourself. 
- Social media profiles. 
- Projects. This may or may not apply to you.
- Blog (optional).

Examples of simple portfolios

## Something on me

- Follow your curiosity. Be curious! That what makes you explore life
- Follow your passion. You don't know yours , then just keep trying many things
- Working for a startup is not a bad thing! Your first internship or job doesn't necessarily have to be in a big company (it has it's perks)
- Knowing and learning JavaScript is future proof
- It's never too late to start coding
- Explore no code and low code options
- Don't get into to tutorial hell
- You don't need to over engineer products if you are building lean
